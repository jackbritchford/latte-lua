# Todo

- Move the Todo:'s from the codebase to here
- Checksum verification of raw file downloads. SHA256/SHA1/MD5 would require an additional library, there are fairly lightweight CRC libraries in Lua but it's 2020...
- Dependencies (?)
- Support for more environments (OpenComputers/ComputerCraft, LOVE2D, GMod, goluwa)
